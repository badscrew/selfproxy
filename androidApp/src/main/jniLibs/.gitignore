# Native SSH Binaries
# 
# Decision: These binaries should be committed to the repository
# Reason: Ensures reproducible builds and simplifies setup for developers
#
# However, if repository size becomes an issue, consider:
# 1. Using Git LFS for binary files
# 2. Hosting binaries externally and downloading during build
# 3. Documenting manual download process
#
# For now, commit the binaries but exclude temporary files:

# Exclude temporary download files
*.deb
*.tar.*
data/

# Exclude checksum files (generated during build)
checksums.txt

# Keep the actual binaries
!*.so

# Keep documentation
!README.md
!BINARY_SETUP.md
!LICENSE
!.gitkeep
